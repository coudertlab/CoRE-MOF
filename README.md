# CoRE-MOF Python package

Easy access to the various versions of the [CoRE MOF databases](https://cmcp-group.github.io/database-tools/),
as a Python package.

Two lines of code give you access to any structure from the databases:

```
import CoRE_MOF
mof = CoRE_MOF.get_structure("2019-ASR", "ZUZZEB_clean")
```
